Graph:

A graph is a non-linear data-structure used to represent relationship between objects 

A graph is defiend as G(V,E) Where,
        V = a finite set of vertices(nodes)
        E = a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices

we can say that, A Graph consits of a non-empty set of vertices or nodes V and a set of edges E.
