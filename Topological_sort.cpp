//Topological sort:

/*
Topological sort of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that 
every directed edges uv come from vertices u to v, where u comes before v 

1. Graph has to be directed
2. There should be no cycle in the graph

Method:

1. Find the indegree(number of incoming edges) of all vertices.
2. Print all the vertices whose indegree is 0 .
